# READMEGenerator

##Description
When creating a repository on GitHub, your README really is the face of your project. Your README will always be very important for anyone else to be able to use and navigate your website or application. If you take the time to create a well-crafted README, this will allow you to show off your work to other developers as well as potential employers. With the README generator I have created, you will no longer need to create a professional README from scratch ever again! If you just answer a few questions, my application can create a README for you! 

##Installation
Here are some softwares or programs that you will need to have installed before being able to use my application:
- VS Code
- GitBash
- Node.js

Step-by-Step:
1. Copy Link: Click the "Code" button within this GitHub repostiory to copy link.
2. Clone: On GitBash, use the command line to write: "git clone _paste link here_"
3. NPM: Use the command line to type in "npm init -y" to install Node Package Manager
4. Inquirer: Use the command "npm install inquirer" to get npm's inquirer package

##Usage
Once all of this is done, its time to get things started.
Within the directory for this project, initialize prompts using the command line to write "node index.js".
After that, you will then just answer the questions and once that is done, it will generate a README.
